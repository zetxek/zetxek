ðŸ“š This is a list of the books that have made a dent on me, especially focused on non fiction. It represents the areas where I have an interest or a passion, either professionally, as a hobby, or intellectually.
I have always wanted to have a "Recommendation list", and it's one of the common questions when discussing a topic that I found myself attracted to - as I will name drop or quote the book.

I have included only books that I have read - so I can have a chat about them, and the "whistlist" at the bottom.

If you see any book that could fit in the list and is missing - let me know! I'm very open to suggestions ðŸ‘‚
